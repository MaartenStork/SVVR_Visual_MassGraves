DICOM Upper Body - Body 1 (2021.003)
=====================================

This folder contains the upper body DICOM slices extracted from Body 1. These were also used as input for MONAI, so less important for the user.

Expected contents:
------------------
- Raw DICOM slice files (e.g., 60824C71, 60824C72, ...)
- Optional: segmentation files (*.nrrd)

These are the upper torso CT scans, typically covering from
the shoulders/chest area upward.
